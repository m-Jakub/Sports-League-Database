### Overview

* The Sports League Database project aims to provide a comprehensive database and management system for sports clubs, players, and agents. Its primary focus is on facilitating player transfers between clubs, enabling clubs to hire agents, and maintaining an up-to-date record of points that clubs have in the league. 

* The database within the contains information about sports clubs, players, and agents. Each club has its own profile, including details such as name, financial information, or number of trophies the club ever acquired. Players are also listed in the database, with information about their contracts, and salary requirements. Similarly, agents have their profiles, highlighting their services and fees. 

* The core functionality revolves around facilitating player transfers. Clubs have the option to hire players who are not currently associated with any club. In such cases, the hiring club takes responsibility for the player's salary. Alternatively, clubs can acquire players from other clubs by offering them a financial amount equivalent to the player's value. 

* Additionally, players can utilize a portion of their salary to pay their agent. This feature aims to simulate the real-world practice of players employing agents to negotiate contracts and handle their professional affairs. 

* There is also provided a visual representation of the current state of points for individual clubs. This feature allows administrators, club owners, and sports enthusiasts to keep track of club standings within a sports league. 

* Overall, the Sports League Database project offers a centralized platform for managing the intricacies of player transfers, agent assignments, and league standings. By utilizing this software, sports organizations can efficiently handle their operations, make informed decisions, and monitor the progress of their clubs within the league.
