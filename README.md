* There is also provided a visual representation of the current state of points for individual clubs. This feature allows administrators, club owners, and sports enthusiasts to keep track of club standings within a sports league. 

* Overall, the Sports League Database project offers a centralized platform for managing the intricacies of player transfers, agent assignments, and league standings. By utilizing this software, sports organizations can efficiently handle their operations, make informed decisions, and monitor the progress of their clubs within the league.
